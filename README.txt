1. Background story:

In July of 1947 an alien UFO crashed in Roswell New Mexico as a result of electrical failure after receiving several devastating lightening strikes.

The disk-shaped craft crashed in the desert, and was later taken to Roswell Army Airfield by resident military staff. 

There was only one surviving alien being of three that were recovered, a 'gray' alien called Airl who was the flight commander and chief engineer of the craft.

The aliens have the ability to readily leave their 'doll' bodies at will; free to drift in open space anywhere in the universe. 

The reason why Airl's body survived the crash is because it was entirely synthetic, similar to the bodies used by character Motoko Kusanaki of Ghost in the Shell SAC.

The other officers onboard, however, were wearing biological bodies which are quite fragile. Fotrunately they were able to escape the electrical spirit trap that prevents us, the spirits which we are within our biological bodies from escaping the solar system. They made it safely bach to their base in the moon within moments of the crash.

After being taken to a secure facility on the Roswell Army, she was subsequently interviewed. 

Since her doll was not equipped with speaking parts, She was interviewed by Matilda MacElroy telepathically.

Matilda, on orders from her superiors, took maticulous notes of each and every interview. 

The resultant information from the interviews was explosive at the very least.

The information presented on this website was taken from the interview transcripts of those interviews.


Website make up:
